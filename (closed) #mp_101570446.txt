[21:13:11] BCraftMG: yes
[21:13:12] xAlhanz04: uh
[21:13:15] Goaw2551: N7TR0
[21:13:18] BCraftMG: Teams have 120 seconds between protecting, banning, and picking. If the timer completes and there is no decision in chat, the team will forfeit their decision and the other team will choose instead.
[21:13:19] Goaw2551: WHERE ARE YOU
[21:13:21] xAlhanz04: nitro where tf r u
[21:13:28] Floth: we choose ok?

[21:14:31] Goaw2551: banger song
[21:14:45] Goaw2551: lets see if he is back on time
[21:14:54] BCraftMG: wait
[21:14:59] BCraftMG: If a timer runs out due to a team failing to protect, ban, or pick, the team will forfeit that choice and as punishment for delay of game, their opponent will be given an additional choice in protecting, picking, or banning (depending on whichever decision is currently underway). A 3 second buffer for Bancho is permitted after the timer has concluded, strictly according to the referee's IRC and no other source.
