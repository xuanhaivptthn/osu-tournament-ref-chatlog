[23:56:49] My_Angel_Chino: Thanks for le match though o7
[23:56:58] BanchoBot: My Angel Chino left the game.
[23:57:18] TerliManor: Thanks
[23:57:36] TerliManor: Did he let me win TB on purpose? xD
[23:57:41] TerliManor: I feel like he woulda easily gotten better score
[23:57:41] BCraftMG: no lol
[23:58:01] TerliManor: Buit i guess chino is really just that bad on alt
[23:58:16] BCraftMG: :skulley:
[23:58:34] TerliManor: LOL
[23:58:37] TerliManor: me and chino
[23:58:39] TerliManor: had less than 1k avg. score
[23:58:40] TerliManor: difference
[23:58:40] TerliManor: xDDDD
[23:58:52] BCraftMG: most sane non hd players
[23:59:53] TerliManor: I mean
[23:59:54] TerliManor: he won hd2 xD
[00:00:03] TerliManor: I mean, i shoulda won it tbh, idk how i did THAT bad
[00:00:11] TerliManor: but i still think nm4 was better pick,knowing i could throw it
[00:00:17] BCraftMG: izz ok you cooked tb
[00:00:24] TerliManor: I mean tbh
[00:00:42] TerliManor: i wouldnt call 320k on a 4.9* tb cooking
[00:00:42] TerliManor: :tf:
[00:00:53] TerliManor: But this tb shoulda been a pool higher anyway
[00:01:04] TerliManor: its so counterintuitive to pool a 5* TB in 5.1* pool
[00:01:10] TerliManor: but this map does validate that
[00:02:00] TerliManor: Anyway
[00:02:41] TerliManor: I gotta go, still gotta a) write ty staff announcement for BDC as that finished today, b) play some valorant and c) find a firetrucking hotel somehow near cologne for next week for work... although i might just drive 2 hours back and forth next week because hotels are like 150€+ a night atm
[00:02:46] TerliManor: and doubt my work is down to pay that xD
[00:02:53] BCraftMG: :stare:

[00:04:52] TerliManor: the ref
[00:05:12] TerliManor: was like "we refs arent ment to ping players 15 mins before match, you are supposed to know when match is, we only are supposed to ping if you arent online shortly before match"
