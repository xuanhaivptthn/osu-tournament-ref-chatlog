[22:36:37] BCraftMG: On Sudden Death picks, SD is enforced and any mod combinations are allowed (not to be confused with freemod rules). If both players in a team fail due to SD, the other team gets that map’s win. If no teams fail, total score will be used to determine the winner.
[22:36:43] NaFish: thats the point i think
