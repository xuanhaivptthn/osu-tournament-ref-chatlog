[02:23:56] BCraftMG: just a reminder
[02:23:56] BCraftMG: If a timer runs out due to a team failing to protect, ban, or pick, the team will forfeit that choice and as punishment for delay of game, their opponent will be given an additional choice in protecting, picking, or banning (depending on whichever decision is currently underway). A 3 second buffer for Bancho is permitted after the timer has concluded, strictly according to the referee's IRC and no other source.
